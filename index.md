Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime conditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception systems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to semantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to target nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA, where a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a confirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer from a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To mitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally considering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a one-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth knowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a novel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In addition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge the knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the student model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to enhance their performance. For example, the Cityscapes to ACDC night task yielded 53.8 mIoU (\%), which corresponds to an improvement of +5\% over the previous state-of-the-art. The code is available at \url{this https URL}.

## Background
The paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
